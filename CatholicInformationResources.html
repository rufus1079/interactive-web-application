                Responding As A Church Community
              </h1>
              <p>
                Many victims feel the church can be a roadblock for them seeking help. They feel they must stay in their marriages. Some victims feel it is their cross to bear. Unfortunately, some clergy have suggested victims must stay in their marriages.  Sometimes victims are even blamed for the violence.  The verses in the bible most used to justify domestic violence is Ephesians 5:22 “ Wives should be subordinate to their husbands as to the Lord”. Verse 24” As the church is subordinate to Christ, so wives should be subordinate to their husbands in everything.”  What is often not shared is the rest of the verses. Starting with verse 21 “Be subordinate to one another out of reverence for Christ” and verse 25 & 26 “Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ loved the church and handed himself over for her to sanctify her, cleansing her by the bath of water with the word.” It goes on to say in verse 28 “So husbands should love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself.”

                    We must speak out against Domestic Violence in our churches, schools and communities
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Be open and inviting for victims to seek help. Become a safe place for victims.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Help “walk” with victims on their journey as they start making positive choices in their lives
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Do not be a roadblock. This might be the first time the victim has reached out to share her/his story so you want to make sure you do everything correctly.  The last thing we want to do is to re-victimize her/him.
                  </li>
