                The Church's teaching  
              </h1>
              <p>
                The US Conference of Catholic Bishops state, “as clearly and strongly as we can that violence against women, inside or outside the home is never justified. Violence in any form physical, sexual, psychological or verbal is sinful often it is a crime as well.   
              </p>
              <p>
                The Catholic Church teaches that violence against another person in any form fails to treat that person as someone worthy of love. Instead, it treats the person as an object to be used.   “The person being assaulted needs to know that acting to end the abuse does not violate the marriage promises.” 
              </p>

                January 1, 2020 - Born of Woman. The rebirth of humanity began from a woman. Women are sources of life. Yet they are continually insulted, beaten, raped, forced to prostitute themselves and to suppress the life they bear in the womb.  Every form of violence inflicted upon a woman is a blasphemy against God, who was born of a woman. Humanity’s salvation came forth from the body of a woman; we can understand our degree of humanity by how we treat a woman’s body. Theirs is the most noble flesh in the world, for it conceived and brought to light the love that has saved us!

                The verbal, physical, and sexual violence that women endure in some marriages contradicts the very nature of the conjugal union. Amoris Laetitia 2016
