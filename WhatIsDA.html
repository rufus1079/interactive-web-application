              </h2>
              <p>
                The United Nations defines violence against another person as "any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual, or mental harm or suffering to the victim, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life.  Anyone can experience domestic abuse in his/her life. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Intimate partner violence refers to behavior by an intimate partner or ex-partner that causes physical, sexual, or psychological harm, including physical aggression, sexual coercion, psychological abuse & controlling behaviors.  These behaviors are unhealthy relationship behaviors.
