                    One in five teens today say that they have been the victim of, or know a friend who has been the victim of, dating violence.

                    Ten tips to help your teen
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <span>Educate yourself</span> on teen dating violence and access resources that will help you begin the discussion with your teen.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span>Talk to your teen </span> about dating violence early. If your teen seems already to be in a dangerous relationship, assure him or her that he or she is not to blame for his or her partner's behavior and that you are there to help.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span>Listen to your teen</span> when he or she approaches you about dating abuse. Explain that you are going to help him or her get out of the situation.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span>Emphasize that when he or she wants help</span>, it is available. Let your child know that dating violence tends to get worse, becomes more frequent with time, and rarely goes away on its own.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span>Work with your teen</span> to identify resources that will help him or her take care of his or herself, provide emotional support, and build self-esteem.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span>Look for opportunities</span> to increase your child's self-esteem. Children who believe in themselves and their own worth are better able to choose good partners.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span>Be realistic when talking</span> to your teen. Teenagers often have a false picture of romantic relationships. Explain that abuse is not love.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span>Share your standards.</span> Talk to your teen about the way he or she should treat and respect others. Explain how you feel he or she should be treated in return.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span>Create an open environment.</span> Be open to all of the questions that your child asks. Don't criticize, judge, or jump to conclusions when he or she asks about relationships.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span>Try not to criticize</span> or “put down” the abusive partner when talking to your teen. Maintaining a neutral position may help your teen to open up about his or her situation, rather than feeling that you're bashing his or her partner.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
